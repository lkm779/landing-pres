The user understands and declares that the sale and consumption of alcohol to persons under the age of 18 is prohibited under UK law and that the use of the platform is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the users. Although the consumption of alcohol at meetings that may be created or scheduled through the platform is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the users, Pre's warns that the consumption of alcohol is harmful to health and should be consumed in moderation. The use of the platform does not in any way or under any circumstances constitute an invitation to purchase or consume alcohol.

You represent and warrant that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; and that your use of the platform does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Pre’s may, in its sole discretion, refuse use of the platform to any user and change its eligibility criteria at any time.
